Switch component is component that has two states - `true` and `false`. 
The default state of the component is false, however it could be change for the purpose of the app via setting  `checked` property to `true`.
To handle state change event you could use `checkedChange` property, which would notify the app, when the value has been changed.
Another useful feature of the component is `isEnable` property, which gives the functionality to make the component unactive.
