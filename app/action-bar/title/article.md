The title of the ActionBar can be easily set by its corresponding property - title. Still, the user can also define a specific icon inside:  
Basic usage of the title and icon of ActionBar:
<snippet id='action-bar-title-icon-html'/>

The icon can only be set in Android platform. It is hidden by default, but you can explicitly control its visibility with the `android.iconVisibility' property.

Furthermore, the title can be customized by placing a content (button, label, layout-components, etc.) directly in the ActionBar.
