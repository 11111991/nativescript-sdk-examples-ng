# NativeScript Code Samples

To go beyond the basic getting started article and get real NativeScript code for common scenarios, we prepared a large set of small, purpose-driven, code samples that you can directly use into your applications.

The code is open sourced and organized in a single [GitHub repo](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-sdk-examples-ng). There is a [companion application](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-sdk-examples-ng/tree/master/app) that includes all of the samples. You can get the source code of the application and start exploring the code there, or you can [read the documentation  articles](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/sdk-examples/overview.html) associated with each of the examples. The application is also very useful as a NativeScript playground - you can use the source code as a starting point and modify them to fit your app needs.

It is very easy to contribute to the samples and we encourage you to contribute any samples you think that will be useful for other developers. If you need a sample that is missing, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-sdk-examples-ng/issues) so that other member of the community can help you.

[Please read the contribution guide here.](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-sdk-examples-ng/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md)

All the samples have automated tests associated with them and you can be sure that they work with the latest NativeScript version.

Currently, the samples are written around the specific APIs, but we will be adding more “complete scenarios” implemented out of the box.

We hope you will enjoy using this resource, if you have any feedback please [open an issue.](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-sdk-examples-ng/issues)
